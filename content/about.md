I’m a freelance Technical Architect, using my skillset to have a wide coverage of technical domains around _DevOps_ organizations and processes (including Agile workflows), _Cloud_ technologies (AWS, Google Cloud), _Backend_ development (Python, Scala) and _Data engineering_ (HDP, CDH, Kafka, Spark, Glue, Data Prep), including some basics on data science.

Coming from a SRE background, I’m driven by curiosity and challenges, traits that allowed me to gain skills in all domains, and I now use those skills to understand all tenants of a customers’ needs, from functional needs to technical constrains in order to answer with the best fitted solution.
