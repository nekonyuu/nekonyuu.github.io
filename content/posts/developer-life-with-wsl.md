## Why did I leave Linux Desktop

In January 2019 I prepared myself for the big jump as a freelancer and one of the first questions was "Which laptop should I buy for my activity ?", as I'd need one of my own.

My list of requirements was a bit high :

* nice battery life (over 8h under IntelliJ)
* good amount of RAM ;
* have an NVidia GPU for CUDA usage ;
* stylus friendly (to be actually able to draw things and take note on it) ;
* Under 2.5 kilograms ;
* Linux-compatible.

If you do not know, finding a laptop fully working with Linux is hard, especially when most powerful laptops have a discrete NVidia GPU alongside the Intel one (mechanism called Nvidia Optimus). In most cases, the Nvidia GPU isn't supported and stays on, eating your battery.

After searching for weeks, I asked myself if I really wanted to limit myself to Linux. One option was Mac OS X, but there's no stylus-friendly laptop, so that one's out. The other option was Windows, and Microsoft announced WSL years ago as well as Windows Terminal in the works.

All those moves from Microsoft appealed to my curiosity, so I wanted to see for myself what all of this is about : I ended up taking something from the Surface line, the Surface Book 2.
