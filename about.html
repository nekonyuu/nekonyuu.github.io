## About

I'm a freelance working currently as a Technical Architect, where I use my skillset to have a wide coverage of technical domains around DevOps organizations and processes (including Agile workflows), Cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud), Backend development (mostly in Scala) and Data engineering (HDP, CDH, Kafka, Spark, Glue, Data Prep), including some basics on data science.

Coming from a SRE background, I'm driven by curiosity and challenges, traits that allowed me to gain skills in all domains, and I now use those skills to understand all tenants of a customers' needs, from functional needs to technical constrains in order to answer with the best fitted solution.
