Following my switch to freelance, I've chosen to get a lighter and pen-friendly new computer
in order to be able to make the most of those new touch/draw devices.

Because of all my criterias (weight, ability to draw on it, dedicated GPU, ...), I've ended up leaving 
good ol' Linux for a Microsoft Surface Book 2, which unfortunately runs only on Windows 10... 
forcing me to actually investigate **Windows Subsystem for Linux**.

Let's embark on the journey to a enjoyable Linux shell on Windows (running Arch, obviously) !
